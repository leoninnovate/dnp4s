/*
8.5.5.2.2 Multiple Object Request, Class 1, 2, 3, and 0
1. Issue a request for Object 60 Variations 2, 3, and 4 using the all data qualifier 0x06.
2. ยง If the response is not Null, verify that the device requests an application layer confirm.
3. If requested, issue an application layer confirm to empty the device of pending events.
4. Generate known event data that includes events from classes 1, 2, and 3.
5. Issue a request for Object 60 Variations 2, 3, 4, and 1 using the all data qualifier 0x06.
6. Verify that the device responds with all the event data as described in the Desired Behavior.
7. Verify that all static data is returned after all event data in the same response.
8. Verify that the response has the same application sequence number as the request. If the request generates multiple
application fragments verify that the application sequence number of each subsequent fragment increments by 1 modulo
16.
9. Verify that only objects in tables 8-3 and 8-4 are returned.
10. Verify that the data is reported using either 8 bit indexing (qualifier 0x17) or 16 bit indexing (qualifier 0x28) for event
data and 8 bit start/stop indexing (qualifier 0x00) or 16 bit start/stop indexing (qualifier 0x01) for static data.
11. Verify that flag behavior complies with Section 2, Note #5.
12. ยง Verify that the device requests an application layer confirm.
13. Issue an application layer confirm to empty the device of pending events. */
