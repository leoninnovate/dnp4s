/*
8.5.5.2.1 Multiple Object Request, Class 1, 2, and 3
1. Issue a request for Object 60 Variations 2, 3, and 4 using the all data qualifier 0x06.
2. ยง If the response is not Null, verify that the device requests an application layer confirm.
3. If requested, issue an application layer confirm to empty the device of pending events.
4. Generate known event data that includes events from all three classes.
5. Issue a request for Object 60 Variations 2, 3, and 4 using the all data qualifier 0x06.
6. Verify that the device responds with all the event data as described in the Desired Behavior.
7. Verify that only objects in table 8-4 are returned and that the events are in time order (oldest first).
8. Verify that the data is reported using either 8 bit indexing (qualifier 0x17) or 16 bit indexing (qualifier 0x28).
9. Verify that flag behavior complies with Section 2, Note #5.
10. ยง Verify that the device requests an application layer confirm.
11. Issue an application layer confirm to empty the device of pending events.
